# Project
->Mini project on Finding Minimum cost path using dijkstra's algorithm.

->Basically,dijkstra's algorithm is used to find shortest path in a graph.

->This algorithm has several applications such as in Digital mapping in Google maps,Social networking applications,Flighting agenda,Robotic path etc.

->It is based on Greedy technique.

#Time complexity: O(n*n)
